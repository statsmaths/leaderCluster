Description: The leader clustering algorithm provides
 a means for clustering a set of data points. Unlike many other clustering
 algorithms it does not require the user to specify the number of clusters,
 but instead requires the approximate radius of a cluster as its primary
 tuning parameter. The package provides a fast implementation of this
 algorithm in n-dimensions using Lp-distances (with special cases for p=1,2,
 and infinity) as well as for spatial data using the Haversine
 formula, which takes latitude/longitude pairs as inputs and clusters
 based on great circle distances.
